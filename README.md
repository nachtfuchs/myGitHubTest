## Advanced Lane Finding Documentation
#### By: Igor Gall

****
The most rubric points to pass the project are discussed in the the jupyter notebook called 
"Advanced Lane Lines.ipynb" that is available in this repository. There I go step by step
through the rubric points and discuss each of the steps to successfully find the lane lines.

In order to execute the jupyter notebook cells successfully, the data from the repository
https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines needs to be in the same directory as
the jupyter notebook. Once the jupyter notebook has access to the image files, it should
run successfully each cell.

This GitHub repository is used to provide access to the video file where lane lines are
identified by my image processing pipeline.
